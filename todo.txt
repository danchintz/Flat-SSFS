- Rewrite access functions to the super block 
- Rewrite freelist bytemap access logic with new location & size from superblock
- Rewrite imap bytemap access logic with new location & size from superblock

//Utilization of syscalls to perform disk file io
- Change memcpy() in read to read() syscall
- Change memcpy in write to write() syscall
